# NutriLog
Flask web application that allows users to log their nutrition. Users login register with their email and once they do they are able to login to the website. The website uses the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API via rapid API. This allows users to input food and quantity with natural language (i.e. 1 slice of veggie pizza) and retrieve the nutrition information for it without details such as the grams, brand, ingredients, etc. The backend framework is flask and bootstrap for the front end.
