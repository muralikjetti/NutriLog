# NutriLog
Flask web application that allows users to log their nutrition. Users login register with their email and once they do they are able to login to the website and set their calorie and macronutrient targets. The website uses the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API via rapid API which allows users to input food and quantity with natural language (i.e. 1 slice of veggie pizza) and retrieve the nutrition information for it without details such as the grams, brand, ingredients, etc. They can then log their food and see what foods they consumed on any one day with each individual food's specific calorie count and macronutrients in addition to the totals for the day and how far they deviated from their target calories and macronutrients for that day. The backend framework is flask and bootstrap for the front end.
